## Overview

This tutorial covers the population model component of the `JoeModelCE` r-package.  The population model is included as an extension to the original Joe Model and leverages a flexible stage-structured population modelling framework that can be modified for different target systems. The underlying population model code was originally developed by van der Lee and Koops (2020)[^fn] and then further modified by [Dr. Kyle Wilson](https://github.com/klwilson23) to incorporate environmental stressors that are linked to survivorship, capacity and growth.

## Input parameters

The inputs for the population model include key parameters defined in the `life_cycles.csv` input file. Users can adjust and modify these values to represent a species of interest or run the model with the default values (currently representing the life history traits for Westslope Cuttroat Trout). These parameters can be modified such that the population model represents a target species of interest. The example below shows life history parameters that will be used to build the stage-structured population matrix model. For a detailed description of the underlying mechanisms of the population model refer the the [CEMPRA User Guide](https://github.com/klwilson23)


van der Lee and Koops (2020).


```{r m0}
# Install the JoeModelCE (first-time users)
# library(devtools)
# devtools::install_github("essatech/JoeModelCE")

# Load the JoeModelCE package.
library(JoeModelCE)

filename_lc <- system.file("extdata", "life_cycles.csv", package = "JoeModelCE")
life_cycles <- read.csv(filename_lc)
print(life_cycles)

```

## Setup the matrix

`pop_model_setup()` and ` pop_model_matrix_elements()` are run first to build the elements needed to run the full population matrix model. You can explore the data objects generated from these functions which include some density-independent components of a matrix model. Below we can see the transition matrix.

```{r m1}

# Setup objects for population model
pop_mod_setup <- pop_model_setup(life_cycles = life_cycles)

# Build matrix elements for population model
pop_mod_mat <- pop_model_matrix_elements(pop_mod_setup = pop_mod_setup)
names(pop_mod_mat)
print(pop_mod_mat$projection_matrix)

```

## Calculate simple matrix elements from the popbio package

Running the next block of code is optional, but it is included for demonstration purposes to highlight how we can use functions from the external `popbio` R package to generate simple matrix elements from an eigne analysis (e.g., lambda values, sensitivities and elasticities etc). Note that these elements consider density-independent growth. In the next section we project the population forward while accounting for density-dependent growth.

```{r m2}
# Preview density-independent transition projection_matrix
  A <- pop_mod_mat$projection_matrix
# Assign nicknames for each stage
  # snames <- c("egg_yoy", "juv", "subadult", "adult")
  # rownames(A) <- colnames(A) <- snames
# Simple density-independent lambda estimate
  popbio::lambda(A)
# Simple Eigen analysis
  popbio::eigen.analysis(A)$elasticities
```

## Density-dependent time series population projections

Project the population forward through time with density-dependent constraints applied. Density-dependence acts on all life stages and is structured as a Beverton-Holt relationship. Compensatory density-dependence is applied and back-calculated solving an equation that sets the global lambda value to 1. The projection runs with stochasticity and naturally hovers around the Adult capacity (K) value. See van der Lee and Koops (2020) for additional details. Note that at this point we are not considering any stressors as the cumulative effect dataframe (`CE_df`) is set to NULL.

```{r m3, fig.width = 7}
# Set the K.adj (K adjustment prior to pop model run)
life_histories <- pop_mod_mat$life_histories
# Mathematical expression of the transition matrix
life_stages_symbolic <- pop_mod_mat$life_stages_symbolic
# Mathematical expression of the density matrix
density_stage_symbolic <- pop_mod_mat$density_stage_symbolic

# Run simple population projection - project forward through time
baseline <-
  Projection_DD(
    M.mx = life_stages_symbolic,
    # projection matrix expression
    D.mx = density_stage_symbolic,
    # density-dependence matrix
    H.mx = NULL,
    dat = life_histories,
    # life history data
    K = life_histories$Ka,
    # initial pop size as stage-structure vector
    Nyears = 100,
    # years to run simulation
    p.cat = 0,      # Probability of catastrophe
    CE_df = NULL
  )

names(baseline)

# Time series of the population
plot(baseline$pop, type = 'l')

# Time series of lambda values
plot(baseline$lambdas, type = 'l', ylab = "lambda", xlab = "year")
```

## Population Projections with CE Stressors

Then re-run the population model projections, but this time add on environmental stressors. Note that in this simple example two imaginary stressors are added `CE_df1` and `CE_df2` with fake data. These stressors target fry capacity and juvenile survival, respectively. The first stressor (`My Stressor1`) reduces the fry carrying capacity by 18% (0.82) and the second stressor decreases the fry survival by 5% (0.95).

```{r m4, fig.width = 7}

# Very simple CE data frame of one watershed 
# and two stressors (My Stressor1, My Stressor2)
CE_df1 <- data.frame(HUC = 123,
           Stressor = "My Stressor1",
           dose = 123,      # Stressor magnitude
           sys.cap = 0.82,  # Effect of vital rate (dose:response)
           life_stage = "fry_parr",
           parameter = "capacity",
           Stressor_cat = "My Stressor1")
# Second stressor - fake data
CE_df2 <- data.frame(HUC = 123,
                    Stressor = "My Stressor2",
                    dose = 123,
                    sys.cap = 0.95,
                    life_stage = "all_juv",
                    parameter = "survival",
                    Stressor_cat = "My Stressor2")
# Stressors dataframe
CE_df <- rbind(CE_df1, CE_df2)
```

Rerun the population model. Note the plots below the black line is the baseline and the red line is the population projection run with stressors included. In each example the population is supressed when the stressors are included.

```{r m4b, fig.width = 7}
ce_pop <- Projection_DD(M.mx = life_stages_symbolic,
                        D.mx = density_stage_symbolic,
                        H.mx = NULL,
                        dat = life_histories,
                        K = life_histories$Ka,
                        Nyears = 100,
                        p.cat = 0,
                        CE_df = CE_df
                        )


# Time series of the population with CE
plot(ce_pop$pop, type = 'l', ylim = c(0, 200))
points(baseline$pop, type = 'l', col = "red")

# Time series of lambda values
plot(ce_pop$lambdas, type = 'l')
points(baseline$lambdas, type = 'l', col = "red")

# Ratio Relative system capacity
baseline_sys_cap <- stats::median(baseline$pop$N[50:100])
ce_sys_cap <- stats::median(ce_pop$pop$N[50:100])
ce_sys_cap / baseline_sys_cap

```
