correlation in mortality through time,M.rho,0.2,,"We included a temporal autocorrelation of 0.6 from the previous year to reflect the long-term trends observed in ocean survival due to large-scale climatic events like the El Nino Southern Oscillation and Paci ˜ fic Decadal Oscillation (Bradford et al.
2005). The ocean survival rate was then split for each brood year between the six months of ocean survival in Year 2 (?oceY2)
and 12 months in the ocean of Year 3 (?oceY3)"
